1. C# fundamentals (classes, methods, interfaces).

2. MVC basics (controllers, models, views).

3. EF Core (database, migrations, LINQ).

4. Authentication (Identity).

5. Dependency Injection & services.


ROAD MAP

🚀 Start Here (Core C# Skills)
Before diving into MVC deeply, get solid with C# basics since everything builds on it:
✅ Variables & Data types
✅ Classes, Methods, Properties
✅ Collections (List, Dictionary, etc.)
✅ OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces)
✅ Async / Await (important for DB & API calls)


🏗️ ASP.NET Core MVC Essentials

Controllers & Actions
-How to handle requests with methods. ✅
-Return Views or JSON data. ✅


Models
-Create classes that represent your data. ✅
-Add validation with Data Annotations ([Required], [StringLength], etc.). ✅


Views (Razor)
-Pass data from controller → view. ✅
-Use Razor syntax (@Model, @foreach, etc.). ✅


Routing
-Attribute routing ([HttpGet("products/{id}")]). ✅
-Conventional routing (/Controller/Action/Id). ✅


📦 Data Access & Persistence

-Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
-DbContext, DbSet, Migrations.
-CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
-LINQ queries.
-Database Relationships
-One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, Foreign Keys.


🔐 Authentication & Authorization

-ASP.NET Identity (common in real apps)
-User registration & login.
-Roles & Claims (e.g., Admin, User).


🛠️ Backend Architecture Practices

-Dependency Injection (already built-in)
-Learn how to inject services into controllers.
-Services & Repositories
-Keep business logic out of controllers.
-Example: ProductService, UserRepository.
-Configuration & Middleware
-How the request pipeline works.
-Common middleware: Authentication, Logging, Error handling.


📈 Next-Level (after comfort with basics)

-REST APIs with ASP.NET Core Web API (similar concepts as MVC).
-Unit testing with xUnit or NUnit.
-Caching (Memory, Redis).
-Security best practices.
